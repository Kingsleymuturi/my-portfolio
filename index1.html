    <p>Programming is one of the best experiences I have had in life. It is more of a dream come true. Moringa school has aided my journey of being a programmer by teaching me basics of programming that have enabled me to create this webpage. Lot's of thanks to the<strong> Moringa school fraternity</strong> for everything. I have also had the chance to work on other projects during my first trials of programming which can be found on the links below.</p>
    <p>These are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="https://kingsleymuturi.github.io/my-own-project/" class="button">Graced Institute Webpage</a></p>
      <p>This project is one that came into my mind as it is a webpage I wanted to create of a school that my nephew studies in.</p>
      <p>I used <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> language to work on this project.</p>
      <p>It is not complete but i'm looking forward to perfect it.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://kingsleymuturi.github.io/cookie-recipe/" class="button">Cookie recipe Webpage</a></p>
      <p>This project was among my very first as I was trying to learn how to make a Webpage. Unfrotunately it doeesnt have much to please one's eyes.</p>
      <p>On this one I simply used <strong>HTML</strong> language only to create it.</p></li>
      <li><p><a href="https://kingsleymuturi.github.io/hello-world/" class="button">Hello World Webpage.</a></p>
      <p>This was also among the first webpages I created as I was trying to perfect on my new skill.</p>
      <p>I also used <strong>HTML</strong> language on this one only.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The above projects are all just but part of my process of learning how to program. I promise more intersting stuff to come in the near future in my webpages.</p>  
    </ul>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently from Thika but I was raised in Ruiru during my early childhood. As I grew up computer technology has always been a part of me as one of my favorite moments was when I was studying computer studies even in primary. I tried some tricks when using command prompt and I always felt like a computer guru when my friends asked me to share with them my ticks.</p>
    <p>I studied at Bethlehem Academy for my primary education and later joined Pioneer School for my highschool education and did some bit of business aftewards.</p>
    <p>The reason why I decided to join Moringa School for programming lessons is because it has always been a passion within me and I just could not avoid it. I want to venture deeper into the world of programming and expect to learn more as time goes by during my learning progress in the school.</p>
    <p>I have many different hobbies which include:
      <ul>
        <li>Playing chess</li>
        <li>Playing soccer</li>
        <li>Golfing</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
      </ul></p>
